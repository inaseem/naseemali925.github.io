							<h2>Open Book <span>(Project)</span></h2>
							<p>How many times we have wished to get some data for our application/website, but couldn't get it because scarpping data from a website is not a good idea. And websites can change their designs from time to time which will result into failures in scarpping. With Open Book we are aiming to give developers an open source system serving content from websites(without actually scrapping it) which will make them productive and efficient.</p>
